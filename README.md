An experimental repository for collecting electron-react-boilerplate (ERB) RFCs. ERB RFCs are
proposals to alter ERB, erb-cli, or the site. They are meant to gather feedback
and collect constraints, as well as to bikeshed various options.

### Warning: Not really open for business

**The text below is preliminary.** We've not really done any RFCs yet
and we don't quite know what process we want. The idea is to start off
with a few "seed RFCs" and gain experience before we start fielding
many RFCs.

### How to open an RFC

First, hop onto the ERB Gitter channel and run the idea by somebody
in the [ERB core team]. If there is general agreement that the idea
is worth pursuing, then you can go ahead and open a PR that adds a new
file to the `accepted` directory, starting from [the
template](template.md). Tag the PR with a subject line like "\[WIP] My
great idea". Opening early helps make the process more
collaborative. We can discuss on the PR itself and ultimately reach
some sort of consensus.

### Decision making process

The intention is for discussion to reach a "general
consensus" -- not necessarily about the *outcome* but about the
*contours of the solution space*. In other words, a general agreement
as to the pros and cons of each alternative, if not necessarily the
relative importance of those pros and cons. Ulimately, decisions
regarding ERB are decided via the [ERB core team]. The
reasoning of those decisions will always be laid out in comments on
the RFC itself.
